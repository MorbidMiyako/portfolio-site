test for favicon

test for design on site

site will be spa

create function to make "stars" appear on background


one test for App, since its a single page
divide tests up into:
    jest functions:
        simple 1+1 tests

    general elements:
        background
        function that creates "stars"
        function that checks scroll position and changes if needed

    front of the page:
        three text divs
            contains the correct text

        linkedin logo & button
            has link attached
            is clickable

        github logo & button
            has link attached
            is clickable
            
        go down button
            is clickable
            has change viewport 
    
    about part:
        two text divs
            cointains correct text

    projects page:
        at least 5 text divs
        fits 2n + 1 text divs, n being amount of projects
        has at least 2 project links
        has n project links


there are two divs containing social buttons -> need to create tests for both

need to add general tests to check if front page, about etc are inside the
mainDiv to ensure the correct structure

updated about part:
    two text divs
        contains correct text
    social buttons div
        contains same as frontSocialButtons

chose to go for falsy when checking amount of divs to slim chance of false
positive

decided to go for a structure such as:
<projectsdiv>
    <h2>projects</h2>
    <projectdiv>
        <h3>projectname</h3>
        <p>description<a>link</a>continue description </p>
    </projectsdiv>
    <projectdiv>
        <h3>projectname</h3>
        <p>description<a>link</a>continue description </p>
    </projectsdiv>
    <projectdiv>
        <h3>projectname</h3>
        <p>description<a>link</a>continue description </p>
    </projectsdiv>
</projectsdiv>

this means the new test setup will be:
    projects page:
        at least 3 divs
    first div:
        has a h2 tag with projects
    eacht subsequent div
        has at least a p tag
            have at least an a tag with an href
        has at least a h3 tag

    create readme.md from blog.txt

- adaptive design -> ensure that site displays properly on phone
    - line height
    - picture after about
    - font size h2 and h3
    - first scroll button to bottom frontPage -> set display to relative
